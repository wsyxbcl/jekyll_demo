<h2>{{ page.title }}</h2>
<p>First article of this site(testing)</p>
<p>I've had a bunch of notes and articles on my hard drive.</p>
<p>The site was based on a free domain thanks to the <a href="education.github.com">GitHub Edu</a></p>
<p>One night was spent to build this pretty rough demo, </p>
<p>and unfortunatly I have no time to spend on it for the busy study life.</p>
<p>Looking forward to complete this stuff when time permits</p>
